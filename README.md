# Microsoft's Entity Framework Designer is dead.

Yet it still ships inside Visual Studio 2026, broken and out of date. Unable to work with moderm projects or SQL providers. And [not accepting new PRs](https://github.com/dotnet/ef6tools/issues/83).

Microsoft's (understandable but still annoying) corporate calculus is leaving developers high and dry.

So the EDMXperts at CloudNimble have taken matters into our own hands.

# Welcome to the EasyAF Entity Designer

[**EasyAF**](https://easyaf.dev) is CloudNimble's platform for warp-speed application development with .NET, powered by EDMX.

**EasyAF.EntityDesigner** is a modern evolution of Microsoft's EDMX experience that works with EF 6.5 and SDK-style projects targeting .NET Framework _AND_ .NET 8+.

We've stripped it down and removed all the legacy code, dependencies, and ugly WinForms UI that bogged it down.

It's now refreshed with a lighter codebase, modern UI enhanced by WPF, and a bevy of new features.

# Why Now?

The Age of AI makes it easy to keep just about anything up-to-date. We recently took the time to make some minor improvements to Microsoft's still-shipping EF6Tools codebase, and were rejected.

The thing is, EDMX is still a very powerful language for describing a database schema. We use it to power data access and code generation in both EF6 and EFCore applications across multiple cloud providers.

In fact, Entity Framework 6.5 runs **great** on modern .NET, It's a valid compatibility path to get legacy apps onto .NET 8+, and there are thousands of EDMX-based applications still being maintained.

We don't need something new here. We just need something that works.

# Planned Improvements

### Features
- Updated layout engine for cleaner diagram re-organization
- New "Dark Mode" rendering style
- More control over SVG outputs
- Better integration with EasyAF tooling

### Codebase
- Continued simplification and modernization
- Move DSL-related code to a single assembly
- Consolidate projects that don't need to be separated
- Better leverage C# 14 language features
- Improve test coverage
